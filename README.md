# thinkfail

A very tiny Python script to prove that Lenovo's P1 Gen 5 and X1 Extreme Edition Gen 5 lose key-presses under certain load situations.

## Usage

Start `thinkfail.py` and keep hitting ENTER at a constant rate. When the fan's state changes, notice that multiple keystrokes are lost.

## Affected Hardware

The affected hardware I know about is using an Intel iGPU.
